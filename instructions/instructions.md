#How to Make a New Post 

##Select "+ New"

![new button](/new.png.)

Enter title. Make it catchy!

Underneath the title is a line that says "Permalink" with a url following. Edit the url so that after "maker.uvic.ca/" there is only one word, like "maker.uvic.ca/post"

Add body of post, add any links or media that you want to appear directly in the body of the post. If there are any blockquotes, put them in italics so they stand out. Read through the body of the post and edit it just one more time to make sure all's well. 

We like pullquotes! Make sure each post has a couple, especially if it's "image-light." Pull out the most profound sentences or fragments you can find. 

At the end of your post, hit "Return," then say:

"Post by AuthorsName Here, attached to the WhicheverWhatever project(s), with the whichever tag(s). Featured image(s) for this post care of whereveryougotit."

Add a link to the author's archive page (maker.uvic.ca/author/yourfirstname), and link the project(s) and tag(s) to their archive pages as well. 

Make sure you then select whichever projects you identified for the post from the "Categories" bar on the right. Please don't add your own category! 

Also select tags for the post from the "Tags" bar below "Categories." Click the "Choose from the most used tags" option and select which ones you want to use from there. Please do not invent your own tags!


*DO NOT SELECT A FEATURED IMAGE YET* That comes later.  

Pay no attention to Shortcodes

##Post Settings:

Most of these are defaulted, but double check anyways.

Display featured image on archive pages: Yes 

Enable navigation for this post: Yes

Upload or choose image from media library: bit.ly/makerpaper 

Image background position: Left

##Post Format

Select post format: Select either "Gallery" if it's a regular post (you will need at least two images), or "Video" if it's a video post. If the images are all different sizes and acting atrociously, make just an "Image" post instead, as it can be fincky and just the worst. 

If a Gallery post, upload the images you're using (at least two) into the "Attached gallerys" section that will pop up. This will add your images to the rest of the media selections on the site. 

*Upload the images in order.* The one you want to appear first MUST be uploaded first, the one you want to scroll to second must be uploaded second, etc. 

THEN go to the feature image window on the right side of the page and select one of your images as your "featured image." 

*DO NOT select an image as your featured image before you upload the ones you want to use.*

Scroll up to the "Publish" bar on the right side, "Preview" if you want to check out your post. Underneath the "Save Draft" button, there is a line that says "Status: Draft" - Click "Edit" and change this to say "Pending Review." 

Then click "Save as Pending" and you're done! 

##FIN.
