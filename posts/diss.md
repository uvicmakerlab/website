<p>At UVic on October 10th, participants will gather together at the Maker Lab (TEF 243), watch a live panel of speakers at CUNY, send questions to the panelists, and contribute (if they wish) to open access documents about writing and defending non-traditional or digital dissertations. Chaired by Cathy N. Davidson, the panel will consist of <a title="learn more" href="http://www.hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson/2014/08/28/what-dissertation-new-models-methods-media#jade" target="_blank">Jade E.

<p>According to Cathy Davidson, the goal of the workshop is &#8220;to showcase, celebrate, and model what it takes to not only produce an innovative dissertation but how to enact the institutional change required to have one approved by your university. That means knowing institutional rules, having the right mentors, being willing to explain yourself in terms of existing structures, goals, and aspirations and how your work moves those along, etc. This session is about success strategies.&#8221;</p>
