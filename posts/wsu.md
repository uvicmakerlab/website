# Where Are the Politics?

March 23, 2015

<p>Today, for <a title="learn more" href="http://www.rogerwhitson.net/" target="_blank">Roger Whitson</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Critical Making in Digital Humanities&#8221; series, I spoke for about an hour on the politics of making, with an emphasis on computer vision, hardware, and community makerspaces/hackerspaces. I believe the talk was recorded. If it&#8217;s published online, then I&#8217;ll add the URL here. In the meantime, below is the poster Roger made for the event. Thanks, Roger! It was an absolute pleasure. (Next time, I&#8217;ll spell-check my abstract. Sorry!)</p>
