<p>The extensive use of memory sticks (a practice considered somewhat archaic in North America) takes place concurrently with the use of the Internet in Cuba, where web access remains limited and difficult today. But this situation is rapidly changing. In Cuba, the infrastructures created by the exchange of digital media through memory sticks and other portable devices offer forms of mobility, sociality, and proximity that the Internet does not strive for.</p>
<p>Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier is professor of Anthropology at the University of Victoria. She conducts research on popular culture, digital music, and alternative networks of music production and circulation in Cuba since 2000. She directed the film <em>Golden Scars</em> (2010) in part funded by the NFB of Canada and is currently finishing a docu-fiction called <em>Farbik Funk</em> (2015) based in the periphery of SÃ£o Paulo.</p>
