#Kits for Cultural History

p>Supported by <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/insight/">a four-year Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant</a>, the Kits for Cultural History project is led by Jentery Sayers (the Maker Lab&#8217;s director) and <a title="learn more" href="http://williamjturkel.net/" target="_blank">William J. Turkel</a> (Western University). The primary aim of the project is to express the histories of media, technologies, and science through new media, especially <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/physcomp/">physical computing</a> and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/fab/">digital fabrication</a> techniques. Since September 2013, a group of Maker Lab researchers has been prototyping, designing, and producing a series of physical kits, which <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/aesthetics/">&#8220;remake&#8221;</a> old technologies and media that have been largely ignored, no longer exist, or are difficult to access. Rather than communicating humanities research solely in a written format, these open-source kits encourage hands-on, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/kit2/">exploratory engagements</a> that playfully <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/determinism/">resist instrumentalism as well as determinism</a>. In so doing, they <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/kit1/">prompt audiences</a> to consider how the material particulars of historical mechanisms are <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/cases/">embedded in culture</a>, without assuming that, in the present, we can ever experience the world like &#8220;they did back then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kits for Cultural History is supported by the <a title="learn more" href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</a>. Jentery Sayers and William J. Turkel are the project&#8217;s principal investigators. With Sayers and Turkel, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/nbelojevic/">Nina Belojevic</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/nicole/">Nicole Clouston</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/shaun/">Shaun Macpherson</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/katiem/">Katie McQueston</a>, together with <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/alex/">Alex Christie</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/laura/">Laura Dosky</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://devonelliott.net/" target="_blank">Devon Elliott</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/kat/">Katherine Goertz</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/jonjohnson/">Jon Johnson</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/danielle/">Danielle Morgan</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/zaqir/">Zaqir Virani</a>, have contributed to the project. The research is being conducted in the Maker Lab in partnership with the <a title="learn more" href="http://williamjturkel.net/2013/02/02/the-history-department-with-a-fab-lab/" target="_blank">Lab for Humanistic Fabrication</a> at Western University. The researchers are based in departments of English, history, and visual arts, as well as the Cultural, Social, and Political Thought program at UVic.</p>
<h4><strong>Project Status</strong></h4>
<p>This project is ongoing, with substantial support through at least April 2017. During the 2013-14 academic year, early prototypes were developed for three different kits: an <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/debut/">early wearables kit</a> (on late 19th-century electric jewellery by Gustave Trouvé), an <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/tennis/">early video games kit</a> (on William Higinbotham&#8217;s <em>Tennis for Two</em>), and an early wire recorder kit. During 2014-15, the team is expanding development of the early wearables kit, producing replicas of Trouvé&#8217;s electric jewellery, modelling and manufacturing cases for the kits, gathering contextual materials, and developing the kits&#8217; scholarly apparatus. By 2018, the Maker Lab will circulate a number of these open-source kits, which will be archived, peer-reviewed, and distributed online and by post.</p>
