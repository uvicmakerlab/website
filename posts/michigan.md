# The Data Knows You Better Than You Do
Jentery Sayers on October 6, 2014   Makerspace 

<p>On Friday I had an amazing opportunity to present during the <a title="learn more" href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/humanities/events/digitalcurrents/ci.datasocialjusticeandthehumanitiesconferencefri3oct2014_ci.detail" target="_blank">&#8220;Data, Social Justice, and the Humanities&#8221;</a> event at the University of Michigan. <span class="pullquote">This one-day conference explored the implications of gathering and analyzing digital data for humanities scholarship in light of social justice imperatives.</span> Activism, archiving, and representation served as interpretive lenses to focus discussion. Corresponding with some physical computing work we&#8217;ve been doing in the Maker Lab, my talk, <a title="learn more" href="http://uvicmakerlab.github.io/michigan/#/title" target="_blank">&#8220;&#8216;The Data Knows You Better Than You Do&#8217; and Other Constructions,&#8221;</a> outlined the <a title="learn more" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) through a digital culture studies perspective. It stressed how the IoT is conceptualized in popular culture, how it&#8217;s practiced across several settings and markets, and how it raises a variety of social justice concerns, which have yet to be significantly addressed by academics, including digital humanities practitioners. During the last quarter of the talk, I also pointed to some important creative and critical projects that are directly or indirectly responding to the IoT&#8217;s social justice elements. Those projects were <em><a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415896955/" target="_blank">Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory</a> </em>(edited by Trebor Scholz), <a href="http://wyldco.com/" target="_blank">Wyld Collective</a>, <a href="http://autonets.org/" target="_blank">Local Autonomy Networks (Autonets)</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/5/circuit-bending-videogame-consoles-form-applied-media-studies" target="_blank">&#8220;Circuit Bending Videogames&#8221;</a> (by Nina Belojevic),  <a title="learn more" href="https://www.seattleattic.com/" target="_blank">Seattle Attic</a>, <a title="learn more" href="https://www.doubleunion.org/" target="_blank">Double Union</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://www.freegeekvancouver.org/" target="_blank">Free Geek</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://machineproject.com/" target="_blank">Machine Project</a>.
