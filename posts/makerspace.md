#The Humanities Lab as Makerspace

<p>Building on its name, one of the Maker Lab&#8217;s ongoing interests is the intersection of humanities research with tacit learning through physical computing, fabrication, material culture studies, and comparative media studies. What can the humanities learn from maker culture? How can experimental methods inform materialist research and cultural criticism? And in terms of not only the production of space and infrastructure but also the design of interactions and workflows, how might a humanities lab function like a makerspace? To what effects on our legacy understandings of collaboration, writing, expression, history, theory, and professionalization? With these types of questions in mind, &#8220;The Humanities Lab as a Makerspace&#8221; project is an ongoing initiative of the Lab, which engages its team (faculty and students alike) in learning by doing, technical fluencies, materialist approaches to culture, project-based learning, and trial-and-error research development (including the use of logs and revision control). Integrating aspects of popular culture makerspaces into a campus environment, the primary impulse is at once to expand the modes and means of humanities research and to build shared interests through problem-based modeling, prototyping, and implementation.</p>
<h4>Research Lead, Contributors, Support, and Partnerships</h4>
<p>The research lead for this project is Jentery Sayers. For its space and infrastructure on the University of Victoria campus, the Maker Lab has received support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, the Department of English, the Humanities Faculty, the Modernist Versions Project, and the Humanities Computing and Media Centre. Additional groups, such as the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab and the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, have supported the Lab&#8217;s makerspace workshops and related initiatives.</p>
<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>This project began when the Maker Lab opened its doors in September 2012 and&#8212;as a general initiative&#8212;will run indefinitely.
