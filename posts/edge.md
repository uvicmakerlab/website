Karly Wilson on October 30, 2013

<p>In the <em><a title="learn more" href="http://www.timescolonist.com" target="_blank">Times Colonist</a></em> this past Sunday (October 27th), journalist Peigi McGillivray published a <a title="learn more" href="http://communications.uvic.ca/edge/" target="_blank">UVic KnowlEDGE</a> piece on the Maker Lab. McGillivray&#8217;s article, &#8220;Tinkering with Scholarship: UVic&#8217;s Maker Lab in the Humanities,&#8221; includes not only commentary from <a title="learn more" href="http://web.uvic.ca/~siemens/" target="_blank">Ray Siemens</a> but also details about our <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/category/kits/" target="_blank">Kits for Cultural History</a> project and a description of the Lab&#8217;s activities in general. The Maker Lab is thrilled with McGillivray&#8217;s synopsis of the work we do here, and with being described as an &#8220;innovative new research laboratory&#8221; that is &#8220;expanding the means and modes of humanities scholarship.&#8221; If you didn&#8217;t grab a copy of Sunday&#8217;s paper, then you can read the full article in <a title="learn more" href="http://communications.uvic.ca/edge/" target="_blank">HTML</a> or <a title="learn more" href="http://communications.uvic.ca/edge/pdf/v13n08-oct13.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> (care of UVic Communications).<a href="http://communications.uvic.ca/edge/pdf/v13n08-oct13.pdf"><br />
