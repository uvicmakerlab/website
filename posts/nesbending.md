#Looking at Games through Circuit Bending
Nina Belojevic on October 3, 2013   Makerspace 

<p>Throughout the last year, my research has focused on videogames. Videogames fascinate me for many reasons, but one primary aspect of videogames that I find especially exciting is the physical interaction required of players. As Anna Anthropy observes, &#8220;A game can&#8217;t exist without a player or players: someone needs to be engaging with the rules for the experience to happen&#8221; (44). Elsewhere, Alexander Galloway makes clear the role of machines in videogames, highlighting the importance of &#8220;action&#8221; in the medium: &#8220;One<em> plays</em> a game. And the software <em>runs</em>. The operator and the machine play the video game together, step by step, move by move&#8221; (2). Outlining the ways in which machine acts and operator acts shape the game experience, Galloway presents a videogame as &#8220;a cultural object, bound by history and materiality&#8221; (1). Furthermore, in <em>Persuasive Games</em>, Ian Bogost describes videogames as an &#8220;expressive medium&#8221; (vi) with the power of persuasive rhetoric. Bogost defines his term &#8220;procedural rhetoric&#8221; as &#8220;the practice of using process persuasively&#8221; (3), thus drawing attention to the machine-based operations that enable &#8220;rule-based representations and interactions rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures. This type of persuasion is tied to the core affordances of the computer: computers run processes, they execute calculations and rule-based symbolic manipulations&#8221; (ix). Through these affordances, computers &#8220;invoke interpretations of processes in the material world&#8221; (5). Thus, through videogames, operators and machines engage in physical, material procedures that take shape in the form of audio and graphic output (among others).</p>
<p>Taking seriously these highly material processes, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/snes/">Jon Johnson</a> and I brainstormed ways of studying videogames at their material level. We both decided to spend this past summer actually engaging with the circuit board of a game console. Since I am not experienced with circuit bending or electronics, I decided to work with an older console: a refurbished Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), which was first released in the United States in 1985. I never owned a game console as a child, so the many ritualistic practices I learned about as I played the NES this summer were incredibly interesting and curious to me. Buttons have to be pushed repeatedly, game cartridges can be quite finicky, the right button on my controller only works if I push the up button first, and I sometimes have to blow into a cartridge for the console to read it properly. All of these small details drew attention to the material nature of videogames, and they ultimately prompted me to bend an NES.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote">Circuit bending allows me to not only study the box and buttons that surround my NES console, but also open it up and dissect its insides.</span> Furthermore, if gameplay combines machine acts and operator acts in a fashion that Galloway thoroughly describes, then circuit bending offers a method of engaging them through their particulars. That is, it offers a way of looking at games that is not possible when one reduces them to narrative, rules, or code. Videogames communicate differently than other media, such as books or film. Rather than relying solely on narrative, player interaction creates an actions-based experience, communicating concepts in a mode distinct from text or images. Similar to Anthropy’s observation that interaction is key to videogames, Jesper Juul notes that the player is always a constant, even if there is no player character (9). He also points out that, while games may use narrative approaches at points within the game, this does not render the game (as a whole) a narrative (3). Furthermore, narrative&#8212;whether in a book or game&#8212;only ever exists in and through a medium (3). However, narrative has been placed “as a privileged master concept in the description of all aspects of human society and sign-production,” distracting from what actually “makes games games” (11). Therefore, it does not always make sense to study games with the same tools (or methods) we use to study literature or film.</p>
<p>The importance of media-specific analysis is a topic that N. Katherine Hayles discusses in “Print is Flat, Code is Deep.” She effectively describes the importance of incorporating material analysis into the study of texts:</p>
<p><em>The crucial move is to reconceptualize materiality as the interplay between a text’s physical characteristics and its signifying strategies. This definition opens the possibility of considering texts as embodied entities while still maintaining a central focus on interpretation. In this view of materiality, it is not merely an inert collection of physical properties but a dynamic quality that emerges from the interplay between the text as a physical artifact, its conceptual content, and the interpretive activities of readers and writers. Materiality thus cannot be specified in advance; rather, it occupies a borderland&#8212;or better, performs as connective tissue&#8212;joining the physical and mental, the artifact and the user. </em>(72)</p>
<p>In this passage, Hayles draws attention to the role that materiality should play in the analysis of textual content. The material media object in which a text appears joins that artifact with a &#8220;user&#8221; and in this role mediates between the content and the interpretive actions of a given reader. Similarly, videogames rely on the physical game console or computer to afford gameplay. <span class="pullquote">Narrative, or the player experience alone, does not fully encompass the game.</span> A thorough study of a videogame requires scholars to also look at the materiality of the platform at hand.</p>
<p>In order to describe circuit bending as a media-specific form of analysis, I also turned to some helpful concepts described in Matthew Kirschenbaum’s <em>Mechanisms</em>. Working from the perspective that a text cannot be read without a medium (xviii-xiv), Kirschenbaum draws attention to the seemingly immaterial behaviour that increasingly defines our interactions with digital media (12). He describes the common occurrence of both screen essentialism and “medial ideology”: the view of a medium based on popular representations and uses, rather than the material particulars of a specific technology (36), with many aspects of contemporary media remaining ignored or unknown “at a simple factual level” (45). He also delineates between “formal” and “forensic” materiality. Formal materiality relies on the assumption that computers afford the manipulation of symbols, not actual matter, usually through screen-based interfaces (11). Thus formal materiality recognizes digital media as “an abstract projection” that can “propagate the illusion . . . of <em>immaterial</em> behavior” (11). Meanwhile, forensic materiality is based on “the principle of individualization,&#8221; or &#8220;the idea that no two things in the physical world are ever exactly alike” (10). Following this distinction, I see circuit bending as an analytic that enables a forensic approach to the study of videogames while maintaining an awareness of how formal materiality is necessarily anchored in platforms.</p>

<p>To engage in such a deep analysis of videogames, we have to open them up and unpack them at the level of their composition. For example, there are a variety of things one can look for on the circuit board, and not every game will contain every element. But recognizing which elements a game does contain can lead to a better understanding of actual gameplay.</p>
<p>In order to more thoroughly explain how a game can be interpreted through the process of circuit bending, below I walk through my experience modding an NES and articulate the findings that emerged from my preliminary investigations. Please note: None of what’s below is intended to be a guide or “how-to” for circuit bending. These are not instructions. If you are unfamiliar with electronics or circuit bending (especially anything that plugs into a wall), then do not try it alone, without an expert. I conducted this project with supervision.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/blue.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-189" alt="blue" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/blue.png?w=300&amp;h=168" width="427" height="240" /></a>Elements: </b>Certain circuit bends draw attention to separate elements of a game, such as sprites, background graphics, sound effects, and the play environment. For instance, in <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, I can create a bend that changes all background layers and visual accessories to blue, so that it visually distinguishes very simplified representations of the sprites and elements with which the player character interacts. Where audio is concerned, I can create a wire connection that triggers the sound of Mario getting a coin, but this sound appears independent from any other action (i.e., Mario does not actually get a coin, and no graphics indicate that he would).</p>
<p><a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/freeze.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-191" alt="freeze" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/freeze.jpg?w=300&amp;h=224" width="250" height="187" /></a></p>
<p><b>Playable vs. Non-Playable Layers:</b> Some glitches remain playable, while others freeze the screen. Frozen glitches detract from gameplay, but they also draw attention to the materiality and electric flows of the technology. Most commonly, a bend will render the game unplayable because the amount of electric current is too high or too low. Thus, the role of electricity&#8212;something that may often go unnoticed when playing a videogame&#8212;is foregrounded.</p>
<p><b>Quality:</b> Every game on each unique console appears on the screen in a certain quality and pixelation; however, one fairly consistent NES glitch changes the pixelation on the screen to create the appearance of lower quality graphics. This glitch highlights the computational nature of the visuals on the screen and offers a material trace at the level of the interface. Pixels can be seen as a result of the material action taking place on the circuit board. In this case, the machine&#8217;s output comes in the form of a pixel, and the pixelation of a videogame represents the processing power of the game console. In the case of the NES, the graphics for each game are optimized for an 8-bit game console, and changing the resistance on the circuit board draws attention not only to the graphics of a game like <em>Mario</em> but also to the electricity that triggers certain forms of output.</p>
<p><a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pixels.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-197" alt="pixels" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pixels.jpg?w=300&amp;h=224" width="250" height="187" /></a></p>
<p><b>Relations:</b> Circuit bending can also highlight the relationships between elements within a game, especially if these elements get distorted. This bend could consist of sprites interacting with one another, or graphics interacting with the mechanics of a game. In <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> one example consists of the actual physics of the game not aligning with visuals on the screen. With this bend in effect, gaps in the ground appear just before or after where the graphics would indicate that they are placed. For instance, it looks like Mario has to jump half an inch later than he actually does, and&#8212;as a result&#8212;he ends up falling and dying.<br />

<b><a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pink.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-195" alt="pink" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pink.jpg?w=150&amp;h=112" width="150" height="112" /></a>Ambience</b>: Some bends maintain gameplay and all game elements, but adjust the visuals slightly (e.g., by changing the scheme). However, such a small change can considerably alter the ambience of the game. A pink sky might make it look like Mario is taking an evening stroll with the sun setting in the background, while a black and white background suggests a nightmare.</p>
<p><b>Time and Space:</b> Some glitches can shift what appears on the screen, thus distorting the time, space, and setting of the game. In <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, one bend shows me the future of the game just before it takes place, allowing me to see a few moments ahead from where I am in the gameplay. This bend provides me with some obvious advantages. It also draws attention to the fact that these advantages are usually unavailable, thus making practice and familiarity with the game a huge factor in gameplay.</p>
<p><a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tetris1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-200" alt="tetris1" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tetris1.png?w=300&amp;h=168" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><b>Game Mechanics:</b> Game mechanics make up a large portion of the basic rules of a game and define the primary forms of player interaction. Some glitches can change or tweak the game mechanic. In <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> I did not find a bend of this sort, but I found a game-mechanic bend that works in <i>Tetris</i>. In this game, geometric square shapes in a variety of arrangements fall from top to bottom in a particular space and need to be placed in a way that allows for as many pieces as possible to fit into that limited space. The player can turn the pieces clockwise or counterclockwise and move them left or right. <a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tetris2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-201" alt="tetris2" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tetris2.png?w=300&amp;h=168" width="300" height="168" /></a> Once a piece reaches the bottom or lands on top of another piece, it remains there until a complete row is filled, at which point the row disappears. The glitch I found shifts the placement of the static pieces between two states, adding a mechanic complication to the game. One piece could be placed based on a certain arrangement, but a switch can change that arrangement, shifting the open spaces. Thus, rather than assuming that the pieces should remain in a static space, the glitch adds another, rather serendipitous layer of dynamics to the gameplay.</p>
<p>These effects allow me to recognize a variety of things about <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> While a narrative approach to the game might analyze the journey of a quirky plumber through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Peach, and a player-focused approach might indicate that the game is about the operator’s skills and knowledge (e.g., knowing where to find hidden bonuses), circuit bending provides very different insights. Based on the effects outlined above, the bends show that, at the most basic level, the player can activate effects that allow her to control and even master the game mechanics. Manipulating a circuit board allows her to directly engage the relations between electricity and the time, space, and physics expressed on the screen.<br />

As this overview indicates, bends can affect both the diegetic and nondiegetic dimensions of games. A change in ambience through the colour scheme might influence the way the player understands the narrative of the game, while a frozen screen draws attention to the presence of a machine. There are numerous other possible bends that I have not yet found, and, of course, other consoles contain very different circuit boards. In addition to the bends themselves, other factors that I experienced during the circuit-bending process shaped my understanding of games.</p>
<p><a href="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/3boards.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-187" alt="3boards" src="http://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/3boards.jpg?w=217&amp;h=300" width="217" height="300" /></a>First, over the course of this project, I had to work with three different NES circuit boards. On the first board, one of the integrated circuits broke and was irreplaceable. I used an entirely different console after that, but was also able to find a third circuit board (without the casing, main capacitor, or any other accessories) to replace the one I broke in my first Nintendo. All three circuit boards had the same elements, but they all consisted of different-sized integrated circuits and differed in other minor ways. This highlights how, although all three boards were mass produced, the composition of the console changed throughout the production process. I also realized how difficult it is to access the materials required to actually fix a broken Nintendo. Although I knew that the integrated circuit that broke was a specific VRAM, and I had the parts number, it was impossible for me to acquire that part in order to replace it on my circuit board. I instead had to buy an entirely new circuit board. Furthermore, the circuit-bending process itself afforded me a particular, rather experimental approach to games. Since little information on bending Nintendo systems was available online, I had to follow the very slow process of working my way through all the notches on the integrated circuits&#8212;all resistors, all capacitors&#8212;until I was finally able to grasp how the circuit board functions and what components do what. To keep track of this process, I had to document my findings (in <a title="view an image" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/notes1.jpg">my notebook</a> and in an Illustrator file) so as to ensure that I could recreate the effects and glitches. This process required me to physically touch the circuit board and prod it in order to understand it. Simply looking at a circuit board would not offer me any significant insights. I had to physically engage with it to learn about it.</p>
<p>This form of analysis draws attention to physical connections and functions that exist on a technically particular level of the game, something that, although so embodied in the way my generation interacted with Nintendo systems as children, cannot be recognized when analyzing the symbolic meaning of the screen-based interface alone.</p>

<p>I think that the development of literacy in playing and tinkering with material objects as a form of archaeological analysis can offer exciting insights that we might not consider if we only engage with our devices via their screens and formal materiality, or with attention solely to player perspectives, narrative, and code. Circuit bending underscores the importance of physical details, contradictions in gameplay, and often incongruous interpretations, which offer additional depth to the study of videogames. Put differently, circuit bending electronic devices provides an interesting, timely, and frequently ignored entry point into the study of media history and its objects.</p>
