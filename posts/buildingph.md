<p dir="ltr">Extending the <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hello/">“Hello World” workshop series</a> supported by the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL)</a>, the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a>, and the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria (UVic), “Building Public Humanities” is a series of free and informal workshops intended primarily for humanities graduate students. The workshops respond to an important yet often overlooked issue at the intersection of public humanities and digital humanities, namely the demand for digital projects not only responsive to current social, cultural, and political issues but also invested in mobilizing knowledge within and beyond the academy. Recognizing that such mobilization demands approaches all too rare in many humanities graduate programs, the workshops give participants at UVic a concrete sense of how to plan, prototype, develop, revise, and assess public digital projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Topics for the workshops include problem-based modeling, speaking for/with community partners, building and sharing process narratives, producing interoperable data and documentation, social justice action planning, and project management. And each event is anchored in media studies as well as&#8212;to borrow a term from Matt Ratto&#8212;<a title="learn more" href="http://criticalmaking.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;critical making,&#8221;</a> two areas the Maker Lab identified as pivotal to the trajectories of digital public humanities. Importantly, the construction and delivery of the workshops relies on a broad range of expertise and a wide array of investments that allow the interprofessional series to draw from generative differences across perspectives and practices.</p>

<h4><strong>Project Status</strong></h4>
<p>This project is ongoing and has extended beyond the ETCL support it received during the 2013-14 academic year. During 2013-14, several &#8220;Building Public Humanities&#8221; workshops took place on the UVic campus, and information about each was published here at maker.uvic.ca. Additional workshops will occur during the 2014-15 academic year. To stay in the loop with the series, follow the stream of posts below. We do our best to regularly publish logs of our work. Please do not hesitate to either comment on a log or email <a title="email the lab" href="mailto:maker@uvic.ca">maker@uvic.ca</a> with suggestions.</p>
