#The Maker Lab after Two Years
Shaun Macpherson on October 9, 2014   
<p>The Maker Lab in the Humanities (MLab) opened its doors in September 2012 as a space to facilitate humanities faculty and student research in physical computing, digital fabrication, and scholarly exhibits.  Since then, the MLab and its <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/people/">team members</a> have received six grants (including grants from the <a title="learn more" href="http://www.innovation.ca/" target="_blank">CFI</a> and <a title="learn more" href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/" target="_blank">SSHRC</a>), published in six peer-reviewed journals, hosted five visiting speakers, offered eleven workshops (in collaboration with the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">DHSI</a>, the <a title="learn more" href="http://mvp.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">MVP</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">ETCL</a>), appeared in at least four established news outlets, presented at over twenty conferences (in Canada, the United States, Peru, England, and Switzerland, among others), and built some really cool stuff—all while working to connect with other scholars in media studies, digital humanities, and science and technology studies. Below is a brief recap of the MLab&#8217;s last two years, complete with links to additional reading. Thanks to everyone who has supported us thus far. We&#8217;re looking forward.</p>
<h3>September 2012</h3>

<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/"><strong>The MLab Opens Its Doors</strong></a>: When the MLab first opened in September 2012, there was already a burgeoning team, including lab director, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/admin/">Jentery Sayers</a>; MVP Director, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/stephen/">Stephen Ross</a>; and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/hastac/">HASTAC </a>scholars, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/alex/">Alex Christie</a>, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/mikka/">Mikka Jacobsen</a>, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/shaun/">Shaun Macpherson</a>, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/jana/">Jana Millar Usiskin</a>, and <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/katie/">Katie Tanigawa</a>. These members brought their diverse skills and research backgrounds to the MLab, and all were committed to expanding not only the work of the MLab itself, but also the idea of a space for collaborative humanities work.</p>

<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/projects/"><strong>Projects Begin</strong></a>: October marked the beginning of many of the MLab&#8217;s major projects for the 2012–13 academic year, including the <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/brown/">Audrey Alexandra Brown Exhibit</a>, the <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/you/">Year of <em>Ulysses</em></a> project (with the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/">Modernist Versions Project</a>), and <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/croc/">The Crocodile Cafe Exhibit</a>. In the best possible way, these projects differed significantly, sparking some exciting interdisciplinary research in the MLab.</p>
