<p><strong>Critical Making Cards: Sketching New Technologies</strong><br />
Garnet Hertz, Emily Carr University<br />
Wednesday 18 March at 4:30pm<br />
Maker Lab in the Humanities<br />
Technology Enterprise Facility (TEF) 243<br />
Public Workshop, sponsored by the ETCL and MLab<br />

<p>Hertz will give a workshop on his newly prototyped “critical making cards” that are currently in development. These cards aim to bring together approaches to technological design like critical making (Ratto), critical technical practice (Agre), reflective design (Sengers), near futures (Bleecker), critical design (Dunne &amp; Raby), values in design (Nissenbaum), tactical media (Lovink), and adversarial design (DiSalvo). The cards are built as an aid for practitioners to put aside traditional engineering goals of efficiency, speed, or usability in favour of more complex cultural, social, and human-oriented values. During the workshop, participants will sketch and prototype a new technology that is culturally relevant, socially engaged, or challenging. In addition, they will give feedback on the critical making cards before the cards are publicly released.</p>
