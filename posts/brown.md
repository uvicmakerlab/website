#The Audrey Alexandra Brown Exhibit
Stephen Ross on September 1, 2012   AABrown  

<p>Audrey Alexandra Brown was a Vancouver Island writer who composed poetry, short stories, and articles during the twentieth century. This scholarly exhibit&#8212;built by Jana Millar Usiskin in collaboration with the Maker Lab, the Modernist Versions Project, the Scalar development team, and the University of Victoria Library&#8212;assembles and showcases Brown&#8217;s archival materials to reflect the conditions that may have led to her relative disappearance during the latter half of the century. The project enables wider access to Brown&#8217;s archival material, increases attention to Brown&#8217;s work, and raises questions about the criteria used to define and canonize literature in a Canadian national context. All materials interpreted in the exhibit are part of the University of Victoria&#8217;s <a title="learn more" href="http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/landingpage/collection/collection24" target="_blank">Audrey Alexandra Brown Collection</a>, which consists of materials digitized and structured by Jana Millar Usiskin. Metadata for the collection follows the Dublin Core ontology.</p>
