#The "Hello World" Workshop Series

<p>An extension of the <a title="learn more" href="http://dhsi.org/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> (DHSI), the Maker Lab&#8217;s “Hello World” workshop series is intended for graduate students at the University of Victoria, giving them opportunities to get their hands dirty in digital methods unfamiliar to them. Regardless of whether they are faculty, graduate students, or visiting scholars, the facilitators assume no technical competencies or previous experience with the workshop material. All workshops are free, last approximately one hour, and are generally open to a total of eight participants. They are almost always conducted in the Maker Lab, and topics range from visual programming, photogrammetry, and physical computing to text encoding, data visualization, and geospatial expression. Like the DHSI, the workshop climate is friendly to anyone with an interest in the intersections of humanities research with technologies.</p>
<h4>Contributors, Support, and Partnerships</h4>
<p>The workshop series is made possible by support from the <a title="learn more" href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a> and the DHSI, based on proposals written by Jentery Sayers, who also organizes the series and makes a poster for each workshop. With releases from all participants and contributors, all workshops are documented, often through the use of photography and video. Among other things, documentation fosters self-reflexive instruction, allowing workshop facilitators to see what went well, what might be improved, and what should be tried again.</p>
<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>&#8220;Hello World&#8221; began with the 2012-13 academic year and will continue through at least 2013-14. To stay in the loop with the workshop series, follow the stream of posts below. We do our best to regularly publish logs of our work. Please do not hesitate to either comment on a log or email <a title="email the lab" href="mailto:maker@uvic.ca">maker@uvic.ca</a> with suggestions.</p>
