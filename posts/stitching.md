<p><strong>&#8220;Stitching Together Speculations along the Z-Axis of Algorithmic Culture&#8221; | Tuesday, September 10th | 12-1 p.m.</strong><br />
<strong> Room C112, David Strong Building | University of Victoria</strong></p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithms routinely make decisions for people with access to them, including decisions about how texts, bodies, and environments should be read. With these routine and often ignored decisions in mind, this talk unpacks how computer vision can be approached critically by scholars of materiality and culture, with an emphasis on &#8220;z-axis&#8221; methods, which privilege speculation, conjecture, and subjectivity through 3D modelling and prototyping techniques.</p>
<p>Jentery Sayers is Assistant Professor of English and Director of the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria.</p>
