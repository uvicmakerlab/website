#NANO: Digital Humanities, Public Humanities
Shaun Macpherson on August 1, 2014   Makerspace 

<p>In March 2013, <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com/"><em>New American Notes Online</em> (<em>NANO</em>)</a>&#8212;an online, open-access, peer-reviewed interdisciplinary journal&#8212;invited Jentery Sayers and the Maker Lab in the Humanities to act as guest editors of a special issue titled, &#8220;Digital Humanities, Public Humanities.&#8221; The MLab team <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/dhph/">circulated a CFP</a> in May that invited submissions speaking to &#8220;how, when, and for whom digital humanities is also public humanities.&#8221; Preference was given to project-based submissions that explored the intersections of technology, computation, critical theory, and social justice. In particular, multimodal pieces across text, image, video, and audio were encouraged.</p>
<p>As hoped, proposals were submitted from across the world and from a wide array of disciplines. After peer review, seven articles were accepted for publication. Each of these articles was then edited by a Maker Lab researcher, with Alex Christie, Jana Millar Usiskin, Jentery, and Katie Tanigawa ultimately co-authoring the issue&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/5/introduction-digital-humanities-public-humanities">introduction</a>. Among the published articles was Nina Belojevic&#8217;s essay, <a title="learn more" href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/5/circuit-bending-videogame-consoles-form-applied-media-studies" target="_blank">&#8220;Circuit Bending Videogame Consoles as a Form of Applied Media Studies.&#8221;</a> In September 2014, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/newteam/">Nina became one of the Maker Lab&#8217;s assistant directors</a>.</p>

<h4>Research Leads, Contributors, and Support</h4>
<p>The guest editors for the issue were Maker Lab members, Adèle Barclay, Alex Christie, Jentery Sayers, Jana Millar Usiskin, and Katie Tanigawa, with feedback from Stephen Ross. NANO founding editor, Sean Scanlan, along with Assistant Editors, Rebecca Devers and Ruth Garcia, also contributed to the issue. Alex, Jana, Jentery, and Katie wrote the introduction to the issue. Other contributors to the issue were Rachel Arteaga, Karl Baumann, Benjamin Stokes, François Bar, Ben Caldwell, Nina Belojevic, Sam Byrd, Jimmy Ghaphery, Elise Chenier, Michelle Habell-Pallán, Sonnet Retman, Angelica Macklin, and Elizabeth Alice Honig.

<h4><strong>Project Status</strong></h4>
<p>This project was officially completed in August 2014. The <em>NANO </em>issue was <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/5">published</a> in July 2014, complete with an introduction co-written by the guest editorial team. In an <a href="http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2014/09/09/city-tech-announces-new-journal-nano-new-american-notes-online/">announcement</a> of the issue&#8217;s publication, writers for CUNY (which supports <em>NANO</em>) called Nina&#8217;s essay a &#8220;highlight&#8221; of the issue, noting that she &#8220;hacks into Nintendo Entertainment Systems to try to reconfigure play potential.&#8221;</p>
