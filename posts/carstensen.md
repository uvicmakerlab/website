<p>Traditionally, technology has been linked to power and masculinity. At the same time, with every new technology, social, power, and gender relations can be negotiated anew. Makerspaces as well as digital fabrication labs (&#8220;fab labs&#8221;) have been discussed as opportunities to change power relations. Among other things, they are expected to erode the relationship between production and consumption, and to change the distribution of power over technology. However, are they also a chance for negotiating the traditional link between technology and masculinity? That is, in what ways are makerspaces and fab labs gendered? In this talk, I analyse the intersections of gender, makerspaces, and fab labs, with attention to access, users, technologies, products, education, community, and empowerment.</p>
