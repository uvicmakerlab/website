#Making Media Art as Feminist Practice
Nina Belojevic on February 15, 2015   Makerspace 
<p>On Friday, February 27th, the Maker Lab and the <a href="http://cfuv.uvic.ca/cms/?page_id=5120" target="_blank">CFUV Womenâ€™s Collective</a> will be hosting an Arduino workshop titled, &#8220;Making Media Art as Feminist Practice.&#8221; <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/shaun/">Shaun</a> and I will facilitate the workshop, and we plan to introduce participants to Arduino by building simple circuits that sense input (such as pressure) from the environment and translate it into visual output (such as light). With participants we will also contextualize technical practices through women&#8217;s histories of computing, and we&#8217;ll discuss the intersections of circuit design with feminist media art (in particular) and feminist practices (in general). </p>
<p>When: Friday, February 27th, at 3:00pm<br />
Where: The Maker Lab in the Humanities (Technology Enterprise Facility 243)<br />
