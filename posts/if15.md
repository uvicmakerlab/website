<p>From making video games to imaging the tongue, humanities research is much more hands-on than you may think. Students and faculty researchers will showcase the exciting collaborative projects taking shape in these research labs: <a href="http://hcmc.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">the Humanities Computing and Media Centre</a>, <a href="http://etcl.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab</a>, <a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/">the Maker Lab in the Humanities</a>, <a href="http://dl2learninglab.com/" target="_blank">the Digital Language Learning Lab</a>, <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/ling/speechresearch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=29" target="_blank">the Speech Research Lab</a>, and <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~adarcy/SLRL.htm" target="_blank">the Sociolinguistics Research Lab</a>.
