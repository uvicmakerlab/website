#CFP: Making Humanities Matter
Jentery Sayers on February 10, 2015   Makerspace 
<p>In January, Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein <a title="learn more" href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/cfps/cfp_2015_ddh" target="_blank">announced</a> that <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> (originally published in 2012 by the University of Minnesota Press) is now a book series from Minnesota. As part of that series, I am thrilled to circulate a call for papers for <em>Making Humanities Matter</em>, which will examine the arts and humanities in an age of programmable worlds and digital/analog convergence. What does it mean to describe humanities scholarship as built, assembled, or constructed? To call a humanities argument a persuasive or provocative object? To understand humanities disciplines as creative disciplines? To, in short, make things in the humanities?</p>
<p><a title="learn more" href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/cfps/cfp_2015_mhm" target="_blank">Read the entire CFP on the <em>Debates </em>website</a>. The deadline for abstracts is 3 April 2015. Collaboratively authored submissions are especially welcome. The <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> editorial team will review all abstracts, and authors of selected abstracts will be invited to submit full manuscripts by 15 June 2015, with peer-to-peer review occurring during July 2015. The volume will be published, in print and online, in 2016.</p>
