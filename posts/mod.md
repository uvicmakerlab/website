#Versioning Modernism
Jentery Sayers on September 2, 2012   ModVers  

<p>In a partnership with the <a title="learn more" href="http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/" target="_blank">Modernist Versions Project</a> (MVP) between 2012 and 2014, the Maker Lab aimed to advance the potential for comparative interpretations of modernist texts that exist in multiple witnesses by digitizing, collating, versioning, and visualizing them individually and in combination. According to the MVP, the primary mission of this project was to enable new critical insights that are difficult without computation. Working with established digital humanities research teams both within and beyond Canada, the MVP and Maker Lab helped establish a set of best practices&#8212;as well as building the necessary tools, workflows, and resources&#8212;to allow scholars to digitize modernist texts, compare multiple witnesses, markup the variants, and display the results in an agile and extensible way. To this end, the Maker Lab assisted MVP researchers with the markup, design, visualization, and interpretation of meaningful variants across modernist texts. It also helped the MVP articulate various ways of studying and expressing versions, through tools such as <a title="learn more" href="https://github.com/danielcarter/jquery.modVers" target="_blank">modVers</a> (built by MVP researchers Tanya Clement and Daniel Carter) as well as through gaming, revision control, and text analysis.</p>
<h4>Research Leads, Contributors, Support, and Partnerships</h4>
<p>The research leads for this project were Adèle Barclay, Stephen Ross, and Jentery Sayers. Versioning Modernism was conducted in collaboration with the Modernist Versions Project, which&#8212;under the direction of Stephen Ross&#8212;partnered with <a title="learn more" href="http://inke.ca/" target="_blank">Implementing New Knowledge Environments</a> (INKE) and many other scholarly groups and projects. The research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and versioning researchers in the Lab included Adèle Barclay, Alex Christie, Adam Hammond, Jana Millar Usiskin, Stephen Ross, Jentery Sayers, and Katie Tanigawa, who collaborated with the following MVP members: Daniel Carter (University of Texas at Austin), Tanya Clement (University of Texas at Austin), James Gifford (Fairleigh Dickinson University), J. Matthew Huculak (University of Victoria), Dean Irvine (Dalhousie University), and Susan Schreibman (Trinity College, Dublin).</p>
<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>This project was completed in April 2014, after Maker Lab and MVP researchers surveyed, tested, and built tools for versioning modernist texts by authors such as Marianne Moore, Djuna Barnes, Jean Rhys, Joseph Conrad, Wyndham Lewis, and Marcel Proust. The tools used included modVers, Juxta, the Versioning Machine, Modernist Commons, and Git. For details, see the stream of posts below.</p>
