Here&#8217;s a quick description of the event:</p>
<h3>Creative and Critical Approaches to E-Waste</h3>
<p>How and to what effects does digital research produce e-waste? And how can faculty, students, and staff at UVic not only become more aware of such waste but also re-purpose it for their creative and critical projects? This conversation will unpack these two questions, with an emphasis on <a title="learn more" href="http://sterneworks.org/OutwiththeTrash.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;convivial computing&#8221;</a> and the materiality of technologies.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
