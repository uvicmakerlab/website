#Building an SNES “Glitch Controller”
Jon Johnson on August 29, 2013   Makerspace  

 <div class="attached_imgs_gallery"></div><p>Throughout 2013, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the social, cultural, and historical questions that video games afford academic study and investigation. Several months ago, Nina Belojevic and I developed a prototype for <a href="https://github.com/jonjohns/LongNowOfUlysses/blob/master/English507/HyperLit/HyperLitRationale.md" target="_blank">HyperLit</a>, a social reading environment that satirically draws on gameful design to encourage people to read a digital version of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>. While I look forward to further work on <em>HyperLit</em>, as of late I have been interested in studying video games as video games.</p>
<p>Specifically, I have always had an interest in fourth-generation 8- and 16-bit game consoles like the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Nintendo Entertainment System (largely because of my own childhood experiences with them). Drawing on work by media artist, <a href="http://www.coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/category/video-games" target="_blank">Cory Arcangel</a> (including &#8220;Super Mario Clouds&#8221;), I am curious about <span class="pullquote">how to modify early video games in order to highlight or even repurpose their essential gameplay elements</span>. However, my skills with coding and game design are admittedly rather minimal, so a key challenge to my research on games has been identifying accessible approaches conducive to learning through tinkering. In June, Nina and I took the &#8220;Game Theory and Game Development&#8221; course at the 2013 Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) and&#8212;while brainstorming for our post-DHSI, directed reading projects with Jentery Sayers&#8212;decided we wanted to somehow engage with past technologies in order to gain a better understanding of the physical mechanics that constitute 8- and 16-bit gaming. Even though we had shared interests, we decided to take slightly different approaches to the project.</p>

<p>I ultimately chose the process of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs6ikfEa9jA" target="_blank">circuit-bending</a> and strategic glitching. By drawing on a number of theorists, including Tara Rodgers, Lev Manovich, Alexander Galloway, Ian Bogost, Richard Grusin, and Jay David Bolter, my project&#8212;a circuit-bent Super Nintendo (SNES) controller that can be used to glitch any SNES game&#8212;suggests that <span class="pullquote">glitching participates in a kind of applied media archaeology</span> that helps media scholars contextualize the very processes of play. Any user of my &#8220;glitch controller&#8221; can gain an understanding, however rudimentary, of how the SNES gaming platform works and how it interacts with other technologies (e.g., television sets). At the same time, my project investigates how &#8220;game-first&#8221; glitching (that is, strategically glitching in a way that sustains gameplay instead of creating unplayable interfaces or games) influences how we understand and study game culture, algorithmic artifacts, and play itself.</p>
<p>It is worth reiterating that <span class="pullquote">my approach is contingent upon haptic exploration</span> and depends highly on trial and error. While I have made a conscious and deliberate attempt to glitch as strategically as possible, I must acknowledge my initial and ironic unfamiliarity (given how many hours I have put into playing games on the platform) with the architecture of the SNES console. I must also acknowledge that this glitch controller project is but a springboard into further academic study and investigation.</p>
<p>Below I have provided a brief outline of the project, its workflow, obstacles and decisions made along the way, and, of course, documentation of the finished prototype. Please note: None of what&#8217;s below is intended to be a guide or &#8220;how-to&#8221; for circuit-bending. These are not instructions. If you are unfamiliar with electronics or circuit-bending (especially anything that plugs into a wall), then do not try it alone, without an expert. I conducted this project with supervision.</p>
<p>The process of actually tinkering, glitching, and building the glitched SNES begins&#8212;predictably&#8212;with the purchase of a used Super Nintendo from a local second-hand store. I purchased the SNES from New Age Thrift on Quadra Street along with three games, two controllers, and all of the necessary cables, cords, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/snes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3369" alt="SNES" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/snes.jpg" width="1150" height="728" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, actually opening the console itself proved to be a challenge. Unlike other digital artifacts and games such as <em>Doom</em> or <em>Half-Life</em>, there is nothing whatsoever “open source” about an SNES. In order to physically open the system, a proprietary “game-bit” is required; a specific socket head was made by Nintendo, for Nintendo systems and cartridges (aligning rather neatly with <a title="learn more" href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=G-4EyYR-QgMC&amp;dq" target="_blank">Manovich&#8217;s suggestion</a> that some—if not most—games are “closed [and] proprietary system[s] . . . that only the original creators can modify” [<a title="learn more" href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=G-4EyYR-QgMC&amp;dq" target="_blank">245</a>]). While I was able to open the SNES game cartridges, I ended up purchasing the appropriate gamebit from the very helpful Hometech Electronics on Burnside road. Once open, it was just a matter of disassembling the spring assembly and, essentially, getting to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/opensnes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3370" alt="Open SNES" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/opensnes.jpg" width="1150" height="1150" /></a></p>
<p>However, before attempting to bend the console, I attempted to glitch just a cartridge. Unfortunately, this yielded very unstable and unusable glitches from a gameplay standpoint. For instance, NHL 95 would crash as soon as any circuit was bent.</p>
<p>When bending NHL 95, I first tried to solder a variety of wires to the main ROM IC of the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nhl95555.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3372" alt="NHL 95" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nhl95555.jpg" width="1150" height="1010" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the best result I could come up with was a glitched title screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nhl95glitch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3374" alt="NHL 95 Glitch" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nhl95glitch.jpg" width="1150" height="1150" /></a></p>
<p>With entirely unplayable and entirely unstable cartridge bends, I decided to begin attempting to glitch the SNES console, an approach that made me somewhat hesitant. (It&#8217;s much cheaper to replace a cartridge than an entire SNES circuit board.)</p>
<p>At first, circuit-bending the SNES console was a process of trial and error, with <span class="pullquote">the objective being to find glitches that would not completely freeze gameplay</span>. Initially, the most stable IC I could find on the board was the RGB Encoder Chip&#8212;a common encoder used for a variety of multimedia platforms and devices&#8212;that essentially converts analog RGB signals into colour TV signals in the NTSC and PAL formats. I was happy with these glitches, as they sustained gameplay while also significantly altering and distorting the screen itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rgb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3376" alt="RGB Glitch" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rgb.jpg" width="1150" height="1150" /></a></p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me during the initial stages of glitching, the RGB Encoder Chip seems to encode signals differently when using an RF adaptor (which I used from the beginning) as opposed to an AV adaptor. As a result, two of my main modifications (i.e., two potentiometers on the controller, each connected to two switches) depend specifically on an RF connection and coaxial cable (a mode of connection often deemed inferior in picture and sound quality to AV). As a result, every possible combination of glitches between the potentiometers and their corresponding switches are contingent upon a specific kind of television with a specific kind of connection (in this case, a now very dated Sony TriniTron CRT television).</p>
<p>As a result of this, my project took on an unexpected turn towards self-consciously <span class="pullquote">making aware the hypermediacy of the “classic” fourth generation combination of a 16-bit console with RF connectivity</span>. To be sure, the ruptures made possible through the potentiometers I have connected to the Encoder IC force an acknowledgement of the console as being playable only through a “repurposed television set, one in which an attached control unit transforms the screen into a different medium” (<a title="learn more" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/remediation" target="_blank">Bolter and Grusin 91</a>), thus refusing any perceived sense of “transparent immediacy” (<a title="learn more" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/remediation" target="_blank">Bolter and Grusin 21</a>) of the game and&#8212;at the same time&#8212;the layers of mediation necessary for the SNES to be played, while simultaneously directing attention to a specific historical means of communication or mediation between the video game console and television&#8212;the lo-fidelity use of the RF adaptor as opposed to the now standard AV connection.</p>
<p>After finding some solid glitches on the RGB Encoder Chip, I soon found a variety of very good&#8212;if not unstable&#8212;bends on the Picture Processing Unit Chip. These definitely yielded some of the best results.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ppuBend.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3377" alt="PPU Bend" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ppuBend.jpg" width="1150" height="908" /></a></p>
<p>Generally, the gameplay was sustained in its entirety. But, as the picture above demonstrates, integral elements of the aggregated computer-generated space were completely erased, leaving only the actionable objects, playable characters, and enemy characters intact. Unfortunately, due to the minuscule size of the IC pins (pardon the blurry photo) on the circuit itself, it was near impossible to bend without bridging pin legs.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ppu.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3378" alt="PPU" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ppu.jpg" width="1150" height="956" /></a></p>
<p>With a better soldering iron and more experienced solderers, it might be possible in the future to strategically bend the PPUs. But, for the purposes of my project, the risk of permanently damaging the pins and chip itself did not outweigh my desire to keep the platform working and intact.</p>
<p>Despite having located a variety of very good bends and glitches on the PPU chips, I was forced to move on to more stable parts of the circuit board architecture. I soon found that two small chips seemingly connected to the PPU chips yielded solid results.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/vram.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3379" alt="VRAM" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/vram.jpg" width="1150" height="1151" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of rupturing the RGB signal between the television and the SNES, all of the bends on the VRAM chips modify, discolour, disorient, or distort the colour palettes, tiles, and sprites of the game. These glitches can be controlled by the four “push” buttons on the controller, with each button glitching different sprites, palettes, or tiles. For instance, the lower left button will explicitly and rather consistently highlight the wireframe or “box” of various moveable or interactive sprites. This can be seen most clearly in <em>Donkey Kong Country 2</em>, where, if the button is pressed, the character will be surrounded by a rectangular box. Similarly, in <em>Turn and Burn: No Fly Zone</em>, the “box” will appear when clicked over interactive elements of the cockpit (including the cross hairs) and the sprites of enemy jets (or, as the game labels them, “MiGs”). This is, of course, just one example; other <span class="pullquote">glitches will erase backgrounds, heavily pixelate and distort elements, or alter the colours and shades of various sprites in the game</span>.</p>
<p>After mapping out a variety of bends and glitches that sustained gameplay while also producing effects that were reasonably consistent across different games, I began the process of soldering. It was, admittedly, a nerve-wracking experience. Despite my having chosen to solder points onto chips with somewhat larger IC pins, it was still a process that I found very difficult. It is interesting to consider, if my soldering skills and tools improved, how the quality, variety, and—for lack of a better phrase—&#8221;relevance&#8221; of the glitches could increase. With a substantially more expensive soldering iron (mine cost $18), it might be possible to solder onto the PPU points I originally identified. Regardless, eventually the easier points I selected were established.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/soldering.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3380" alt="Soldering" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/soldering.jpg" width="1150" height="1157" /></a></p>
<p>By this point I had decided to have the glitch controls situated onto a modified game controller as opposed to simply glitching the console itself. By doing so, the glitches themselves become less like “on/off” operator acts and more akin to fluid acts of play. That is, <span class="pullquote">the glitch controller is meant to be utilized and played while another player is engaging the game itself</span>. Of course, it is important to note that by contextualizing this mode of glitch-play through a &#8220;closed&#8221; or &#8220;boxed&#8221; object&#8212;the controller&#8212;I am partially undoing the work of experimentation and haptic tinkering that I have been so keen to do. In other words, I am ironically continuing in the tradition of providing a polished, user-friendly device that mimics the practices of video game companies like Nintendo or Sega.</p>
<p>To build a prototype, I first needed a controller. I was able to find a used NES controller from Hometech Electronics.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quickshot.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3381" alt="Quickshot" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quickshot.jpg" width="1150" height="948" /></a></p>
<p>After purchasing it, I quickly pulled out the controller&#8217;s guts and got to work. I drilled a hole and installed a socket in the SNES for all the required wires. However, for reasons I still don&#8217;t understand, adding several feet of wire to each point resulted in a significant amount of unwanted distortion and “grain” when playing the game. I can&#8217;t help but think of <a title="learn more" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=987991" target="_blank">Tara Rodgers&#8217;s suggestion</a> (by way of Barthes) that such “grain”&#8212;emerging as a result of glitching, tinkering, or hacking&#8212;constitutes the “body” (<a title="learn more" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=987991" target="_blank">Rodgers 317</a>) of the producer/maker within the game/instrument. Regardless, some of the distortions were much worse than others, invariably resulting in me picking new points to solder and bend. It was definitely a frustrating hiccup to hit at a somewhat late point in the build process.</p>
<p>Eventually, the controller started to take shape. After removing the guts, I attempted to reinstall switches and buttons from the original controller.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/controllerGuts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3382" alt="Controller Guts" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/controllerGuts.jpg" width="1150" height="1227" /></a></p>
<p>After playing with different combinations of switches, buttons, and potentiometers, I decided to select two potentiometers (each connected to two switches) along with four main push buttons. I decided on push buttons for a couple of reasons. For one, somehow the push buttons feel more “gamic.” Generally, video game controllers do not feature on/off switches. Instead, video game controllers generally demand a certain sense of engagement; Mario would not really be Mario if one could simply turn on a jump button that would repeatedly have the character jump at the correct intervals. By having the glitches connected to push-buttons, then, <span class="pullquote">the glitch-player is unable to be overly passive about her/his involvement in the game</span> being played. That is, she/he cannot simply engage in a configuration act. Instead, the glitches are meant to be expressive and continually experimented with. They are meant to be tweaked.</p>
<p>Eventually, the controller was finished.</p>
<p><a href="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/controllerdone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3383" alt="Controller Done" src="http://maker.uvic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/controllerdone.jpg" width="1150" height="863" /></a></p>
<p>Here are two very brief videos of the glitch controller in action.</p>

<p>While I am relatively happy with the final product, I am interested in expanding the glitch work I have done here to include sound. It would be interesting, I think, to have a separate controller that would primarily bend and tweak sound and music within the game. However, the SNES sound chip is extremely unstable. For instance, throughout the entire bending process, I was unable to find a sound-bend that would not crash gameplay. Still, with the help of colleagues and further investigation into the SNES platform, <span class="pullquote">sound-bending might be possible</span> and would likely add an excellent dimension of critical glitching to the project.</p>
<p>2013-14 looks like an exciting year for the Maker Lab here at UVic, with some great opportunities for collaboration and glitching on the horizon. I look forward to seeing where this project goes, and we&#8217;ll keep you posted about new research developments related to physical computing, gaming, media archaeology, and the like.</p>
