Larson&#8217;s stories have appeared in <em>The Iowa Review, Boulevard, The Virginia Quarterly Review, Alaska Quarterly Review</em>, and <em>Best American Short Stories.</em> <em>The Iowa Review</em> published his novella, <em>Syzygy</em>, in 1998. He has also published travel writing, magazine features, and paid op-eds.</p>
