<p><strong>Book Nerds in a Lab: Making Things in the Humanities</strong><br />
Presented by the <a title="learn more" href="http://english.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">Department of English</a> at the University of Victoria<br />
Thursday, March 6th (3:30pm &#8211; 5:00pm), <a title="find it" href="https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=University+of+Victoria,+hickman&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=48.46383,-123.314109&amp;spn=0.01208,0.027874&amp;sll=48.463304,-123.314645&amp;sspn=0.01208,0.027874&amp;hnear=Hickman+Bldg,+Victoria,+British+Columbia+V8P+5C2&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank">Hickman (HHB)</a> 116</p>
<p>What does it mean to make things in the humanities? To conduct applied humanities research? To weld artistic practice with the study of literature and history? Join us to chat with over 15 student and faculty researchers about the collaborative projects they are building in UVic&#8217;s Maker Lab. This event will begin with a brief presentation by Stephen Ross (Director, Modernist Versions Project) and Jentery Sayers (Director, Maker Lab in the Humanities) on the role of making things in the humanities. We will then transition into two rounds of four concurrent demonstrations:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Hello World! Building an LED Circuit&#8221;</strong> (with <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/nbelojevic/">Nina Belojevic</a> and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/katiem">Katie McQueston</a>): Work with researchers from the Kits for Cultural History project to not only build a simple LED circuit but also learn more about the legacies of <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/debut/">&#8220;wearable technologies.&#8221;</a> During this demonstration, we&#8217;ll provide participants with the materials they need to make a simple circuit and explore wearables.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Warping Historical Maps&#8221;</strong> (with <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/adele/">Adèle Barclay</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/alex/">Alex Christie</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/katie/">Katie Tanigawa</a>): With researchers from the MVP and INKE teams, learn more about how historical maps can be digitally manipulated to express literary representations of early 20th-century cities (including Dublin and Paris). Also learn more about how 3D modelling software is being integrated into humanities research.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Making Analog Audio&#8221;</strong> (with <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/laura/">Laura Dosky</a>, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/jonjohnson/">Jon Johnson</a>, and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/zaqir/">Zaqir Virani</a>): Ever wonder how sound was recorded before the emergence of digital technologies? With members of the Kits for Cultural History team, see how early magnetic recording and sound transduction worked by constructing a low-tech recording device using everyday materials.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Remaking <em>Ulysses </em>with Twitter&#8221;</strong> (with <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/stefan/">Stefan Krecsy</a> and <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/admin/">Jentery Sayers</a>): For scholars of literature and language, Twitter is increasingly becoming a research tool. During this demonstration, learn more about the MVP&#8217;s &#8220;Year of <em>Ulysses</em>&#8221; project, its use of Twitter to facilitate public discussions of the novel, and several ways to gather and express Twitter data.</p>
