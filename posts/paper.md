#Photos from Our Paper Speaker Workshop

 <p>On Friday, January 31st, the Maker Lab held a small, <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/category/hello/">&#8220;Hello World&#8221;</a> workshop&#8212;designed and facilitated by <a title="learn more" href="http://maker.uvic.ca/author/katiem/">Katie McQueston</a>&#8212;where we built paper speakers and a small amplifier circuit that boosts the signal from a regular 1/8&#8243; headphone jack. (We used the headphone jacks on our phones to test the circuit.) Participants learned how to build both the speaker and the amplifier by each receiving a bag of component parts and an excellent illustrated instructional booklet, which Katie also designed. (The paper speaker itself was included as a punch-out in the booklet.)</p>

Electricity that flows through the copper coil creates an electromagnetic current, causing the coil to vibrate around a neodymium magnet inside the cone. The vibrations emit an audio signal from the amplifier circuit. The amplifier circuit is powered by a nine-volt battery. Punk music was heard.</p></div>
